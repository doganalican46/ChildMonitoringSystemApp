___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## Objective: 
To develop a Child Monitoring System Application using modern programming tools.
## Programming Languages: 
Java, MySQL
## Tools:

## Description of the Project:
Solution for missing children with the help of GPS technologies. The application uses two mains
services that is GPS and telephonic services. For location services is GPS and telephony services
is SMS, call logs and contacts. Android is a widely used OS used by a lot of masses globally.
Internet is used for communicating between children and parent side. The System can be designed
in a simple way. The application developed to make user-friendly approach on both sides. The
parents and children both should have GPS Based smart phones. The application is used to track
the Childâ€™s location as well as call logs, messages and contact from their smartphone. Reason for
choosing android OS is that to target more users.

Basically, the project is to develop a Child Monitoring System Application. The application should let two different kinds of users to work, namely, the parent and the child. Users should have the following functionalities in the system: 
### Parent:
    â€¢	Log in to the system
    â€¢	Add a new child
    â€¢	Edit child information (delete, update etc.)
    â€¢	See the child current location
    â€¢	Send a notification to the childâ€™s phone (like do your homework or 6 pm dinner time)
### Child:
    â€¢	Log in to the system


# Interfaces:
	
  The application should must have to user-friendly interfaces. The target audience is parents so we 
  need to design something simple but totally useful. For the design part we will use AdobeXD. 
  There are two main users for this app. We just need 1 log-in page and 3 or maybe more then 3 module pages.
